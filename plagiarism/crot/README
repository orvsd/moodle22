IMPORTANT:
Bing API will be depreciated as of Aug 01, 2012. It means global search 
will not work any more in Crot. You can still use it for local 
detection. for local detection you do not need to set up AppID

		- Grammar size is size of text used to calculate one hash in document fingerprint. Recommended value is 30.
		- Window size represents how granular tech search will be. Recommended value is 60.
		- Colours are used for highlighting of similar text fragments in the side by side comparison of documents. But at the moment colouring function works only with the one colour (#FF0000).
        - Max Distance between hashes in the text cluster: This parameter is used for allocation of hashes into text clusters in the colouring of similar text fragments. Recommended value is 100.
		- Minimum cluster size is a minimum number of hashes in the text cluster used for colouring of similar text fragments. Recommended value is 2.
	    - Default Threshold: Assignments with similarity score less than threshold value are not displayed on Anti-Plagiarism - Assignments page.
   		- Global search threshold reserved for future development. Recommended value is 90.
   		- Global Search Query Size is the number of words in the query for global search. Recommended value is 7.

9. Click Save Changes button
10. IMPORTANT: You need to setup CRON running on your server to have Crot running. Please refer to the implementation section below. 

IMPLEMENTATION
1. Login as a teacher to Moodle.
2. Go to the course, then to the assignment that you want to be processed by the antiplagiarism plugin. At the moment the plugin works with the following types of assignments:
	- Advanced uploading of files
3. Click Assignment administration/Edit settings link.
4. In the Crot block set up search parameters.
5. Save settings and wait for the cron scheduler to process the assignments.
   IMPORTANT: setting cron on Moodle is covered in Moodle doc: http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Cron
	EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: You need to set up cron running php command from the command prompt, NOT using wget command as it will cause cron timeout.
   If you are not sure how cron works on your server please ask your system administrator about it.
   Processing may take significant time: it depends on the server power and external channel bandwidth. Please be patient and wait for cronjob to be over.
   Global search consumes more time as it requires querying the search engine and downloading similar files from the Internet.
6. Go to the assignment, click "View submitted assignments" link and you will see the maximum similarity score for submitted files.
7. Open the link with similarity score and compare documents.
