Ad-hoc database queries

This report plugin allows Administrators to set up arbitrary database queries
to act as ad-hoc reports. Reports can be of two types, either run on demand,
or scheduled to run automatically.

Other users with the right capability can go in and see a list of queries that
they have access to. Results can be viewed on-screen or downloaded as CSV.

Reports can contain placeholders, in which case, the user running the report is
presented with a form where they can enter the values to substitute for the
placeholders before running the report.

See http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Custom_SQL_queries_report for more information.
